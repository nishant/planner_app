Group #:
* 10

Group Members:

Minimal Project Goal:
* Our minimal goals are to make what was described in the
provided list of ideas. 
* Our application would be comprised of a main view linking to 4 other smaller applications. 
* We want to support a homework/assignment tracker, fitness tracker,
sleep tracker, and calendar. 
    * The homework tracker would be similar to a simple to-do list app. 
    * The fitness tracker would track steps and distance traveled. 
    * The sleep tracker would simply track the userâ€™s hours of sleep.
    * The calendar would be similar to the inbuilt iOS calendar.

Stretch Project Goals:
* Track heart rate and elevation in fitness tracker. 
* add an alarm clock into the sleep tracker
* add a notification system by date and time in the calendar app.
* make our assignment tracker exportable to PDF.
